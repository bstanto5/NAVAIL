                <p>Specify which SCALE to use to decide the colour of the icon for this node.</p>
        <p>After the percentage usage is calculated (using BANDWIDTH/MAXVALUE and data from the TARGET line), 
        the colour is decided by looking up the percentage against this SCALE. If there is no USEICONSCALE
        line, then no scale is used, and the icon colour does not change.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Icon colourising uses the PHP <tt>imagefilter()</tt> function. This function
		is <em>only</em> available in the version of GD that is bundled with PHP, and not with the official GD library. Several
		popular operating systems (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu) use the official GD library rather than the bundled PHP library. USEICONSCALE
		<em>will not work</em> on those systems. You should get a warning when the map is produced, and check.php should also tell you 
		this. check.php will also tell you if you are using the bundled GD library or not.</p>
