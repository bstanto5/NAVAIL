                <p>Specify which SCALE to use to decide the colour of this node.</p>
        <p>After the percentage usage is calculated (using BANDWIDTH/MAXVALUE and data from the TARGET line), 
        the colour is decided by looking up the percentage against this SCALE. If there is no USESCALE
        line, then the default scale is used.</p>    
        <p>For nodes, you can also specify a scalename of 'none'. This stops the node's colour from changing at all. This is useful if you want to 
        use the TARGET line to fetch data that is used in the LABEL or ICON of the node, for example, without changing the colour of the node itself.</p>
