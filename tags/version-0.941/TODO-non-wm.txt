QuickTree plugin
----------------

Tab at top. 
Allow dragging of any graph onto the tab to build up a temporary 'shopping cart' of graphs you are working on right now.
Click on the tab to see the graphs. 
Save the cart as a tree?
Needs something like jQuery, and a page_top hook.
Would be a LOT easier if HTML used more classes and ids and less tables. Mainly more classes though.
Alternative to use the graph_items hook and a little icon (like killspike)

Tree modifications
------------------
Allow plugins (?) to define arbitrary 'tree objects'
- plugin provides the UI to pick them
- plugin provides the code to draw them into the tree

E.g. Weathermaps, visio diagrams or other files, big lumps of wikitext,status in another system.

Needs a real 'type' field added into the tree_items table, and the tree drawing code needs to know about it in quite a few places.

Add a few base types: graph, heading, subtree (as now), plus file, text.


User/Host Properties
--------------------

WhatsUp-style properties for a host.
API to allow plugins to access it?
- how is this different from current plugin_mytable situation?


"Explain"
---------
SQL-style. 
Choose a graph, and get a diagram showing what templates, data queries etc are contributing to that graph. How the title was arrived at, etc.
