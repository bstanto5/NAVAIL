This is a fresh import of the 0.92 release code, plus the supporting files
- the Makefiles and source for the manual (it's done with XML and XSLT)
- the Makefile for the release itself
- the various little bits and pieces

Depending on what is happening, there is a good chance that this version
won't run completely. That's what you get for downloading from SVN instead
of waiting for a release.
