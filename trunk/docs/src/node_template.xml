        <p>By default, each new link starts with the same set of properties. You
	can change the default properties by defining a link called DEFAULT.</p>
    <p>You can also use the TEMPLATE keyword to make a link inherit it's settings
    from <em>any</em> other link. The link you use must be defined earlier in the
    config file than where you use it.</p>
    <p>You can make template-only links that are not visible in the map, by not
    including a NODES line in the link. Template links can also use templates, to
    build up a hierarchy of 'types'.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The TEMPLATE line should be the first line in the NODE
    definition, as it will copy the configuration over the top of anything else you
    have already defined for that NODE.</p>
