Rebuild References (should be VERY RARE)
 ./run-tests.sh /usr/local/bin/php references

# Run tests with default PHP (PHP5 for me)
 rm results/* && ./run-tests.sh /usr/local/bin/php results-php5

# Run comparison against references
 ./compare-results.sh php5

# Run test with PHP4
 rm results/* && ./run-tests.sh /usr/local/php4/bin/php results-php4

# Run comparison against references
 ./compare-results.sh php4
